    <h2>What Is Beef Wellington?</h2>
    <p>Beef Wellington is a luxurious main dish made with beef tenderloin coated with paté and mushrooms, wrapped in puff pastry, and baked until the pastry is a beautiful golden brown. The classic English dish is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 ounces liver paté</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare Beef: Place the beef tenderloin in a baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons of softened butter over the beef.</li>
        <li>Bake Beef: Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the beef from the pan, reserve the pan juices, and let the beef cool completely.</li>
        <li>Increase Oven Temperature: Increase the oven temperature to 450°F (230°C).</li>
        <li>Sauté Vegetables: Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion and mushrooms in the butter for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let them cool.</li>
        <li>Prepare Paté Mixture: Mix paté and the remaining 2 tablespoons of softened butter in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the paté mixture over the beef and top it with the onion and mushroom mixture.</li>
        <li>Roll Out Puff Pastry: Roll out the puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place the beef in the centre.</li>
        <li>Wrap Beef: Fold up and seal all the edges of the pastry, ensuring the seams are not too thick. Place the wrapped beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cut a few slits in the top of the dough and brush with egg yolk.</li>
        <li>Bake Wellington: Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 425°F (220°C) and continue baking until the pastry is golden brown, about 10 to 15 minutes. Use an instant-read thermometer to check the centre; it should read 122°F to 130°F (50°C to 54°C) for medium rare. Let it rest.</li>
        <li>Prepare Sauce: Place the reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine, and boil until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the Beef Wellington hot with the prepared sauce. Enjoy!    </li>
